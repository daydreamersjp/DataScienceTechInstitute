## 2. Reinforcement Learning Coding

  These codes are to follow the blog posts of reinforcement learning ["Disserting Reinforcement Learning"](https://mpatacchiola.github.io/blog/2016/12/09/dissecting-reinforcement-learning.html) with adjustments to notations according to the [RL lecture series by David Silver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWv7GOvuf0) of DeepMind.
